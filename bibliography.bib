abstract = {This paper deals with the development and validation of a finite element numerical model of a grand piano soundboard. The most important details of the manufacturing process are reproduced in this model. In particular, by modelling the gluing of the ribs and the bridges to the board, the curved geometry (the crown) and the residual stresses induced in the soundboard are taken into account. Experimental modal analysis results are presented at three stages of the manufacturing process of the same soundboard: (i) freely suspended soundboard before gluing the bridges, (ii) freely suspended soundboard including the two bridges, and (iii) soundboard attached to the piano frame. The experimental data at the first of these three stages are used to update the material properties of the finite element model, so as to minimise the difference between calculated and experimental vibration modes, in terms of both natural frequencies and mode shapes. The simulation of the other manufacturing stages is then performed without any additional tuning. Vibration modes obtained from experiments up to 400–450Hz are compared with those obtained through the numerical model. Point mobilities measured on the bridge at the different manufacturing stages are also shown and discussed. Above 200Hz, the mobilities measured on the bridge of the freely suspended soundboard and on the bridge of the soundboard fixed to the frame are very similar, thus showing that in this frequency range the effect of the soundboard local dynamic stiffness is predominant over boundary conditions. Finally, point mobility at the bridge is also calculated through the finite element model and compared to the experiments, with good agreement up to 4kHz.}

abstract = {Experimental modal analysis (EMA) is the empirical study of the dynamic properties of structures under vibrational excitation. Non-contact EMA is advantageous when the target is susceptible to damage or contamination. In this study, we investigated non-contact EMA as we excite a cantilever beam using a collimated air impulse controlled by a solenoid valve. The reflected airwave from the beam surface was measured by a microphone array. The air actuation is calibrated by utilizing a separate pressure sensor that simultaneously measures the air impulse. The effect of changing the pressure and the opening time interval of the solenoid valve are investigated and found to be adequate for the frequency range of interest. The force transferred from the air impulse to the target depends on the upstream pressure, as well as the gap between the target and the nozzle. The effect of changing both the pressure and the gap distance between the target and the nozzle on the magnitude of force is investigated with a series of tests. Pre-processing is performed on the reflected signals to minimize the noise level, and the optimal gap distance between the sensor array and the target is found. The experimental tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to both accurately and cost-effectively measure structural dynamics in translational and rotational degrees using a non-contact excitation and sensor mechanism.}

abstract = {A number of vibration mode-shape measurement techniques are described in which the measurement point of a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is continuously scanned over the surface of a sinusoidally excited structure. The LDV vibration output is an amplitude-modulated sine wave and mode shapes, defined along the scan line, may therefore be established by demodulation. Alternatively, in the frequency domain, the LDV output is a line spectrum, with sidebands centred on the excitation frequency and spaced at the scan frequency. The sideband amplitudes give series coefficients for the mode shape defined along the scan line—Fourier coefficients for a circular scan or, via a simple transform, polynomial coefficients for a sinusoidal straight line or area scan. Useful measurements can also be made, directed at a single point on a structure: a small-diameter circular scan will give the angular vibration of the structure at the centre of the circle; a conical scan, produced with a short-focus lens, will measure the translational vibration at the point of focus, in magnitude and direction.}
