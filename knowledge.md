I trained as a luthier in London at Noden Guitars which has given me a practical understanding of stringed instrument building, maintenance and repair. My experience here also raised further questions about the nature of musical instruments manufacture. I had witnessed the traditional woods for musical instrument become more expensive and scarce.

During both my undergraduate and masters programmes I gained experience of undertaken acoustics measurements of musical instruments. I have solid grounding in best practices for impulse response recording both for instruments and physical spaces for room acoustics. During this time I also received instruction on computer programming in lisp, C and MATLAB. My position as Digital Development Technician for Edinburgh College of Art allowed me to expand my understanding of the ecosystems for web development, mobile application development. As a result I am comfortable programming in most major programming languages.

As the Digital Development Technician, I assisted staff and students who wished to explore the creative potential of computer programming and electronics. I was also apart of the Software Carpentries committee, a transdisciplinary group with representatives from departments across the University, that focused on providing rapid up-skilling for academics in the domain computer programming. The digitisation of society was a pressing topic within the committee as we aimed to train academics in the use of digital tools for data gathering, cleaning and, analysis, whose field did not traditionally call up those skill-sets.
