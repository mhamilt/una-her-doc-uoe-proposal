I have trained as a luthier in London at the string instrument and repair workshop Noden Guitars. My time training has given me a practical understanding of stringed instrument manufacture, maintenance and restoration. The experience at the workshop also raised further questions about the nature of the fabrication of musical instruments. 

During both my undergraduate and masters programmes I gained experience of techniques involved in acoustics measurement. I have a solid grounding in best practices for the recording of impulse response, both for instruments and physical spaces for room acoustics. During this time I also gained experience in computer programming using LISP, C and MATLAB.

After graduating from the masters programme I was employed as the Digital Development Technician for the Edinburgh College of Art. I assisted staff and students who wished to explore the creative potential of computer programming and electronics. I was also part of the Software Carpentries committee, a transdisciplinary group with representatives from departments across the University. The committee was focused on providing rapid up-skilling for academics in the domain of computer programming. The digitisation of society was a pressing topic within the committee as we aimed to train academics in the use of digital tools for data gathering and analysis for those whose field did not traditionally call upon those skills.

Therefore, my skills lie at the intersection of physics-based analysis of musical instrument, their manufacture and sustainable software development for academia, which together gives me a firm grounding for a project of this kind.
