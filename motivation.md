- your academic interests

Interested in tackling the challenges of sustainability and reproducibility with respect to musical instrument production and historic instrument conservation.

- purpose

Software sustainability

The digital systems that we author today should be maintainable if they are to be used for conservation.

Digital conservation of musical instruments and the digitization of society.

- objectives

To author transparent and accessible frameworks that bridge the gap between the domains of computer science, organology and cultural heritage.

Aim is to create an open source hardware and software toolkit for non-contact measurement for wooden musical instrument soundboards. The tools would be used to analyse frequency response of soundboards as well as non-invasive estimation of material properties.

- motivation in undertaking this postgraduate study.
A musical instrument pose the interesting problem of being both a tool and an aesthetics object. My motivation is to try and explore how curators, luthiers and musicians can continue maintain and interact with the musical instruments of our past accessibly, without jeopardizing them.
