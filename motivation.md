> Please give a short statement that describes your academic interests, purpose, objectives and motivation in undertaking this postgraduate study.

My core academics interests are the physics of musical instruments, its application to their fabrication, and tackling the challenges of sustainability and reproducibility. 

My motivations stem from my time training as a luthier and observing the rise in CAD/CAM processes in musical instrument manufacture. I also observed the environmental impact of the industry along with further international restrictions of the materials used during instrument production.

My objective is to explore how digital technologies can be used to produce more accessible and economically viable tools for the analysis of historical musical instruments.

Musical instruments pose a challenging problem in that they are both a tool and an aesthetic object. Curators, luthiers and musicians need to be able to maintain and interact with historical musical instruments without endangering their structural integrity. My academic purpose during this project is to address this issue by exploring and creating tools that can assist in this process.
