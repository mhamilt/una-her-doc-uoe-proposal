The topic is concerned with Automated Non-Contact Measurement System Design For Musical
Instrument Soundboards. Vibration analysis is a useful tool for musical instrument
makers and restorers in order to understand the materials with which they are working.
Analysing vibration also gives an understanding of material frequency response
and provides a means of estimating material properties that would typically
be derived through more intrusive and potentially destructive methods. 

A major limitation in non-contact vibrational analysis is in the cost of
equipment that is required to perform it. Laser Doppler Vibrometers (LDV) retail
for upwards of £10,000 whilst Scanning LDVs (SLDV) retail for £80,000. The cost
of such equipment makes non-contact vibrational analysis inaccessible to most. 

The goal of this project would be the design of a non-contact measurement system
that is economical to fabricate in comparison to current commercially available
laser vibrometers. LDVs and SLDVs provide a degree of accuracy that is not
completely utilised when analysing musical instruments. By reducing the
accuracy, and thus the cost of individual components, it should be possible to
create an LDV / SLDV that is more affordable.

The output of the project would consist of an open-source data repository
containing the following:

- a document outlining the design of a low-cost, non-contact measurement system
  for musical instrument soundboards.
  - instructions for self-assembly
  -  the design process    
     -  technical description of components
     -  limitation in precision
- 3D models for digital fabrication
- software toolkit for control of the laser and processing of the collected data
